# Classification project

# Project Description:
TELCO is a telecommunications company that provides communication and media services to customers. Some of these services include: phone services, online security and backup, device protection, tech support, streaming tv, and streaming movies. The TELCO churn database has customer account information and customer demographics. I am looking into drivers of customer churn and seeking actionable conclusions to assist TELCO in preventing customer churn.

# Project Goal:
* Discover drivers of Telco customer churn
* Use drivers to develop machine learning models to predict whether or not a customer will churn.

# Initial Thoughts:
My initial hypothesis is that monthly charges and contract type are the biggest drivers of churn.

# The Plan
* Aquire data from codeup database

* Prepare data

  * Create Engineered columns from existing data
    *
    *

* Explore data in search of drivers of churn

  * Answer the following initial questions:
    * Do senior citizens churn more or less?
    * Does a customer monthly charge rate affect churn?
    * Does contract type (month-to-month, one-year, two-year) impact customer churn?
    * Does having dependents impact customer churn?
  
* Develop a Model to predict if a chess game will end in an upset

    * Use drivers identified through exploration to build predictive models of different types
    * Evaluate models on train and validate data
    * Select the best model based on highest accuracy
    * Evaluate the best model on test data
    
* Draw conclusions
